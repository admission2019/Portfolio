Check the pdf files for the reasearch papers mentioned in my C.V.

1. Object-oriented Neural Programming (OONP) for Document Understanding. arXiv preprint arXiv:1709.08853.£¨ Accepted by ACL 2018£©. This work introduced a novel neural network with structured memory modules which could process sequential data in a human-like approach.
2. Learning When to Make Classification Decision in Reading. arXiv preprint arXiv:1807.02314. (Accepted by IJCAI 2018)
This work proposed a recurrent neural network structure trained in a reinforced learning approach could find the rationales in a paragraph.
3. Training deep neural networks with discrete state transition. Neurocomputing, 272, 154-162. This work proposed a discrete parameter-update approach for training neural networks. I joined this project and assisted in the algorithm implementation.
4.  Outline Extraction with Question-specific Memory Cells.  (coauthor, submitted to Transactions on Asian and Low-Resource Language Information Processing). This work proposed a key-value memory mechanism applied in the recurrent neural networks and tested it in outline extraction applications.
5.  Topological Convolutional Neural Networks for Transient Stability Assessment on Massive Historical Online Power Grid Data. (co-author, Submitted to Future Generation Computer Systems). This work introduced an updated graphical convolutional neural networks which could be applied to data in non-euclidean data.


Also, here are some files introducing the EEG & EMG projects mentioned in my c.v.

1. "Aigemed" is a start-up we founded to automatically analyze EEG signals for the epilepsy diagnosis.
    (1) "Aigemed-BP.pdf" is the business plan introducing this project. 
    (2) "demo-EEG analysis.mp4" is a demo for the online analysis service we built. Sorry about that the introduction in the video is recorded in Chinese. If I may explain the video, it shows the interface of the web-based EEG analysis system. The system firstly recognizes the spikes, slow waves and other disease-related patterns in the EEG signal using deep learning and time-frequency techniques and then generates a diagnosis report automatically.


2. The EMG band project is aiming to utilize gesture recognition based on EMG signals as a human-computer interface. I designed and built the machine learning algorithm for EMG classification in this project, which is based on Support Vector Machine and Convolutional Neural Network.
    (1) "EMG band concept video.mp4" is showing the concept we described of EMG gesture control. 
    (2) "demo-EMG ppt control" is a demo video showing the process of controlling a ppt presentation with hand gestures.
